# Roseibium sp. Sym1 Hybrid Genome Assembly

Accompanying script and output files to the publication, "Complete Genome Sequence of Roseibium sp. Strain Sym1, a Bacterial Associate of Symbiodinium linucheae, the Microalgal Symbiont of the Anemone Aiptasia" in Microbiology Resource Announcement, an American Society of Microbiology journal

We sequenced and assembled the genome of a ubiquitous bacterial associate, Roseibium (formerly known as Labrenzia sp.) of the cnidarian microalgal symbiont, Symbiodiniaceae linuchae. Long reads were sequenced using the MinION Oxford Nanopore platform. Short reads were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 2000 platform (paired- end reads of 2x150bp). Both types of reads were used to build a hybrid assembly of the bacterial genome.

Annotations in the script describe input files, and all analyses can be re-created by starting with the raw .fastq files available for download at NCBI SRA under accession code: PRJNA884430.

A full annotation of this genome can be found at JGI IMG/MER under Project ID: Gp0612333, under "Roseibium sp. Sym1 re-assembly" (https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/projects?id=Gp0612333).
