# Roseibium sp. Sym1 hybrid genome assembly
# Script and input files for hybrid genome assembly of the bacterium, Roseibium sp. 
# Emily Aguirre, emilyagu@usc.edu

#We sequenced and assembled the genome of a ubiquitous bacterial associate, Roseibium (formerly known as Labrenzia sp.) of the cnidarian microalgal symbiont, #Symbiodiniaceae linuchae. Long reads and short reads were used to build a hybrid assembly of the bacterial genome.

# Annotations in the script describe input files, although all analyses can be re-created by starting with the raw .fastq files available for download at JGI IMG/MER #under Project ID: Gp0612333, under "Roseibium sp. Sym1 re-assembly" (https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/projects?id=Gp0612333)
